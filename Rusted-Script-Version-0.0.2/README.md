## Setup

Setup development with **Rusted Script** on your computer.

### Shell Enviroment

If you want to play around and see what Rusted Script can do, run the shell like below;
Run [shell.py](https://github.com/Rusted-Script/Rusted-Script/blob/master/src/shell.py) with python3!
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Rusted-Script/Rusted-Script.git
$ cd Rusted-Script
$ cd src
$ python3 shell.py
```

### Rusted Script Interpreter

The current version of the interpreter may have bugs, as it is still in Pre-Alpha (Version 0.0.2)! If you come accross any bugs, dont hesitate to open a issue.

First make a simple .rusted file, and then run the following;
```
$ python3 src/interpreter.py #### Your file path here #### ../test.rusted
  # After that, the Rusted Script interpreter will run your code.
```
