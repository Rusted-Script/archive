# Variables

Variables store a certain data type, such as boolean, string, integer, and more. Variables are stored in memory and you can get their value anytime in the script.

## Define A Variable

To define a variable, follow the examples below;

```rusted
var {NAME OF YOUR VARIABLE} = ${VALUE OF YOUR VARIABLE]
// An example would be;
var myvar = "hello!"
// now myvar is the string "hello"
```

## Reassign A Variable

You can reassign a variable like below;

```rusted
var myvar = "hello"
// myvar is "hello"
var myvar = "bye" // reassigned the variable "myvar" to "bye"
// myvar is "bye"
```
