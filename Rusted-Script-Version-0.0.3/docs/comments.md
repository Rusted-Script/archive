# Comments In Rusted Script

You can add comments to .rusted files anywhere! Here is a code example;

```rusted
// This is a comment
 # This is a comment
/* 
    This
    Is
    A
    Multiline
    Comment
*/
```

***Disclaimer***
If you make a single line comment with `/* and */` the interpreter will throw an Error!

All of the above are valid ways to write comments in Rusted Script!
